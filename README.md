# Project: Snake From Scratch
> Snake proved to be the perfect entry-point beginner project that I was looking for. Hands down, I recommend this project to start with to anyone interested in C++, or game development. You will learn the basics of what are needed to make a game work, and possibly much more.

## What I have learned from this project:
<details>
  <summary></summary>
  
* Basic game loop
* Making a module from the game's subsystem:
  * Game map module
* Rendering / Displaying an array:
  * Using the Extended ANSII table
  * Using UNICODE chars for the console
  * Simple double buffering
  * Simple framerate limit
* Basic movement:
  * Input checking
  * Snake movement
* Collision:
  * Game map collision
  * Apple collision

### Spoiler Warning:
> If you plan on solving Snake with C++ yourself, consider not checking my theory and solution so you can ponder it about yourself. The section below contains my, and my friend's approach, and ultimately the solution. You've been warned.
